# 47 string methods are available for python, we will be looking at the main ones.


# capitalize() Method
The capitalize() method in Python transforms a string so that only the first letter is uppercase while the rest of the string becomes lowercase. For example, calling capitalize() on "hello WORLD" results in "Hello world", ensuring that only the first character is capitalized. This method is useful when formatting sentences or user input to maintain consistency. It is especially helpful in applications where text must follow proper sentence case formatting. However, it does not work correctly with multiple sentences in a single string, as it only affects the first character. Despite this limitation, it remains a valuable tool in text processing tasks.

# title() Method
The title() method in Python converts the first letter of each word in a string to uppercase while making the rest lowercase. This is useful when formatting text for headings, book titles, or proper names. For example, applying title() to the string "hello world" results in "Hello World". However, it does not correctly handle exceptions like "McDonaldâ€™s" or "iPhone," as it capitalizes every word's first letter. Despite this, title() remains a handy tool for basic text formatting. Many programmers use it when dealing with user-generated text that requires a neat and readable appearance.

# swapcase() Method
The swapcase() method in Python changes uppercase letters to lowercase and lowercase letters to uppercase. This method is useful when dealing with case-sensitive text transformations. For example, applying swapcase() to "Hello World" results in "hELLO wORLD", which completely reverses the case of every character. It is often used in applications where text needs to be obfuscated or reformatted for a stylistic effect. While it is not commonly used in everyday string processing, it can be helpful in creative text formatting or debugging case-related issues. This method works effectively on both letters and ignores numbers and symbols.

# upper() Method
The upper() method in Python converts all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase. This is useful when you need to standardize text for comparison, such as checking user input without worrying about letter case. For example, applying upper() to "hello world" results in "HELLO WORLD", making the entire string uppercase. It does not affect numbers or special characters, ensuring only letters are modified. This method is commonly used in applications that require case-insensitive processing, such as usernames or passwords. Since upper() does not modify the original string but returns a new one, it can be easily used in various text manipulation tasks.

# lower() Method
The lower() method in Python converts all uppercase letters in a string to lowercase. This is particularly useful when working with case-insensitive searches, ensuring consistency in text processing. For example, applying lower() to "Hello WORLD" results in "hello world", making all letters lowercase. It is commonly used in applications where user input needs to be processed uniformly, such as in search functions or database queries. This method does not modify non-alphabetic characters, making it safe for processing mixed content. Like upper(), lower() does not change the original string but instead returns a new one with the transformation applied.

# find() Method
The find() method in Python searches for a specific substring within a string and returns the index of its first occurrence. If the substring is not found, it returns -1, indicating that the search was unsuccessful. For example, applying find("world") to "Hello world" results in 6, because "world" starts at index 6. This method is useful in string searching operations, such as checking if a keyword exists in user input. Unlike similar methods like index(), find() does not raise an error if the substring is missing, making it safer to use. It also supports an optional start and end index, allowing more refined searches within a specific portion of the string.

# index() Method
The index() method searches for a substring within a string and returns its first occurrence's index. If the substring is not found, it raises a ValueError, unlike find(), which returns -1. It is useful when you expect a string to contain a specific word and need its exact position. This method also allows specifying a start and end index for a more precise search. For example, searching "world" in "Hello world" returns 6 because "world" starts at index 6. However, if the substring is missing, the program will stop with an error, so using find() might be safer in some cases.

# startswith() Method
The startswith() method checks whether a string begins with a given substring and returns True or False. This is useful when validating input formats, such as checking if a file name starts with a specific prefix. If the substring matches the start of the string, startswith() returns True; otherwise, it returns False. It also supports optional start and end indexes to check within a specific part of the string. For example, "Hello world".startswith("Hello") returns True, but "Hello world".startswith("world") returns False because "world" is at the end, not the start.

# endswith() Method
The endswith() method checks whether a string ends with a given substring and returns True or False. This is useful when validating file extensions, such as checking if a filename ends with .txt or .pdf. If the string ends with the specified substring, endswith() returns True; otherwise, it returns False. It also supports optional start and end indexes to check within a specific range. For example, "Hello world".endswith("world") returns True, but "Hello world".endswith("Hello") returns False because "Hello" is at the start, not the end.
