# append() method
The append() method adds an element to the end of a list. Unlike insert(), which allows inserting at a specific index, append() always places the new item at the last position. This method is useful for dynamically building lists, such as collecting user input or storing data from loops. It modifies the original list in-place, meaning no new list is created. The append() method can add any data type (numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.). It is commonly used in loops and data processing tasks.

# clear() method
The clear() method removes all elements from a list, leaving it empty ([]). It is useful when you need to reset a list without creating a new one. Unlike reassigning list = [], the clear() method modifies the list in-place, preserving its original reference in memory. This method is often used in data processing, where a list needs to be reused. The method does not return anything; it just clears the existing list. It is commonly used in cases like resetting user input, cleaning temporary data, or clearing caches.

# copy() method
The copy() method creates a shallow copy of a list, meaning it duplicates the elements but not nested structures. Unlike list2 = list1, which creates a reference to the original list, copy() creates a new independent list. This prevents accidental changes to the original list when modifying the copied one. However, if the list contains nested lists, only the outer list is copied, while inner lists still refer to the original memory. To completely duplicate a list, including nested structures, use deepcopy() from the copy module. This method is useful for preserving original data before modifications.
